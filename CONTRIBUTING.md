# Contributing

A brief overview over the project, its dependencies and build instructions.

## Modules

Clapgrep consists of two modules:

- core, which contains the search logic.
- gnome, which is a Gtk + Adwaita frontend.

## Requirements (for Fedora Rawhide toolbox)

These are required when building Clapgrep on Fedora Rawhide **without Flatpak**.
This is only useful for development and the `just check/build/test/run` commands.

```sh
sudo dnf install just meson appstream cargo clippy gcc libglvnd-gles
sudo dnf install just gtk4-devel libadwaita-devel gtksourceview5-devel poppler-glib-devel
```

And you have to install [blueprint-compiler](https://jwestman.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/blueprint-compiler/setup.html) which also requires `python3-gobject`.

## Compilation and Development

- Clapgrep requires up-to-date library versions (Fedora Rawhide or newest Gnome SDK)
- The [`justfile`](./justfile) provides convenient commands for compilation and development.
- `just ci` can be used to run the CI locally.
- You have to run `just setup` once to make `rust-analyzer` work.

## Translations

I recommend using the [Translation Editor](https://flathub.org/apps/org.gnome.Gtranslator) app to edit translation files.

New translations can be added by running

```sh
just add-translation [language code]
```
